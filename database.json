    "descrption": "According to experts, 80% of learning is visual, which means that if your child is having difficulty seeing clearly, his or her learning can be affected.  This also goes for infants who develop and learn about the world around them through their sense of sight.  To ensure that your children have the visual resources they need to grow and develop normally, their eyes and vision should be checked by an eye doctor at certain stages of their development.",

    "name": "Comprehensive Eye Exams",
    "descrption": "Comprehensive eye examinations are much more than just getting a glasses prescription. The doctors thoroughly examine the front and back part of the eye for any eye or systemic diseases and also screen for glaucoma. In fact, determining a glasses prescription is a separate procedure from an eye examination and is called a refraction. Many times the doctors will perform a refraction at the same time as a comprehensive eye examination, depending on the needs of the patient.",
